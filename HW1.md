Hello world!

Hi All,

My name is Min. I'm originally from China and right now I work in Detroit in one of the Daimler subsidiaries. I studied accounting in college and currently I work in automotive industry. I have learned a little bit Java when I was in college and a bit R language from Analytic 500 and 502 in HU.

I'm a certified scuba diver and I also love sky diving.
